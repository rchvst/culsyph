gotta get your culture syphoned, guy

instructions

1: you need to modify the $StorageRoot variable (download path) to cs_syphon.ps1 as $StorageRoot ($StorageRoot = 'Y:\Mecha\mpl_trimmed')

2: you need to modify the $BitsFilter variable in cs_diskwrite.ps1 and cs_bitsqueue.ps1 to match the root of the path you just set in step 1 ($BitsFilter = 'Y:\')

3: run launch.cmd > opens 3 instances of powershell, one for each role - they'll stay open when you control+c to break out of them

4: that is all I think.  provide feedback and I'll get to it.


I'm not malicious I'm just a leech - I'm sharing this because I think it works pretty good.
